# HTML JOURNEY
This is the html floder where i have written all my codes that i have learned from apna college.
 I have written all sample code for most of the tags like Heading tags , paragraph tag , image tag , video tag , tables , blod , underline , lists and forms. 
 By doing assignments and creating portfolio , it helped to increase my interest towards coding .
 At first forms felt little bit difficult by practising i understanded it is not too hard to learn .
